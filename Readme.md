# Skill Tokenization Smart Contract

## Vision

The **Skill Tokenization** project aims to create a decentralized learning ecosystem that rewards individuals for acquiring new skills. By leveraging blockchain technology, we empower learners to earn and spend tokens, creating an incentive-driven environment that promotes continuous education and skill development. This platform not only recognizes users' efforts but also fosters a community where knowledge sharing and personal growth are encouraged.

## Contract Address

**Contract Address**: `0x70439e09edfb246d9c6d4db751f5ed351af558d3a94526fedbcab08f1990a5a8`  

## Features

1. **Token Earning Mechanism**:
   - Users can earn skill tokens by completing educational activities, such as courses and training modules.
   - The `earn_tokens` function allows users to accumulate tokens based on their learning achievements, enhancing their motivation to learn.

2. **Token Spending Capabilities**:
   - Users can spend their earned tokens on additional courses or educational resources, creating a cycle of learning and skill acquisition.
   - The `spend_tokens` function ensures that users can only utilize tokens they have earned, encouraging responsible usage and planning.

3. **User-Centric Structure**:
   - Each user has a unique record of their skill tokens stored on the blockchain, allowing for transparent tracking of earned and spent tokens.
   - The `UserTokens` struct keeps an accurate count of each user's total earned tokens, enhancing accountability.

4. **Secure and Decentralized**:
   - Built on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring the security, transparency, and immutability of user transactions.
   - Utilizes Aptos Framework features to manage signer permissions and facilitate smooth token transactions.

## Future Scope

1. **Course Marketplace**:
   - Develop a marketplace where users can list, buy, and sell courses, using the token system to facilitate transactions and reward course creators.

2. **Integration with Other Platforms**:
   - Collaborate with existing online learning platforms to integrate the tokenization system, allowing users to earn tokens across various educational environments.

3. **Gamification**:
   - Introduce gamified elements, such as achievements, challenges, and leaderboards, to enhance user engagement and motivation.

4. **Expansion of Tokenization**:
   - Broaden the project to encompass a wider range of skills, enabling users to earn tokens for skills beyond traditional education, including workshops, certifications, and professional development.

5. **Community Engagement**:
   - Foster a community where users can share experiences, provide feedback, and suggest new features, driving continuous improvement and innovation within the platform.
